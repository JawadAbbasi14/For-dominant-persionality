# MJ — Personality OS (Dominant)

[Live Demo](https://jawadabbasi14.github.io/For-dominant-persionality/) • Status: **v1.0 — Action-First**

---

## Summary

* This repo is a modern blueprint for building a **dominant, high-agency personality** — designed with the tone and precision of someone who has lived the principles, not imagined them.
* Books here act as **strategic upgrades**, not inspiration: each one sharpened into a practical tool for leverage, clarity, and social authority.
* Follow the system and you evolve from “learning dominance” to **operating like someone who naturally sets the tempo of any environment**.
